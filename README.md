Project Title: Air Pollution

Project Description: 
We addressed a problem concerning nature and pollution. We started with location data. All of our data’s came from different research and we made the relationship between them. To address the air pollution problem, we though it would be ideal to look ad fossil fuel consumption. Because it releases CO2 - a key cause for air pollution. We also backed this with a CO2 pollution data. Then we looked at ozone concentration, which is again a way to show air pollution. We decided to look at deaths from air pollution. To our surprise, it didn’t rise with the increasing pollution. We thought this might be because of the evolving health care technologies.

What we did: 
To clean out our data, we dropped the columns without iso_codes. Then we decided to look only to 1990-2015 year gap, to make things easier to understand. Therefore we filtered the date column. We removed duplicates from all of our data. We also separated some of our data’s information, which was complicated to read due to commas. We also selected columns that are useful for our topic. For example, to have the fossil energy consumption data, we dropped other energy columns about other energy sources.
